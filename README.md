* To view "Figure 4: Multiple comparisons with the best (MCB) plot for the models across the two sets of covariates. BSTS-X<sub>MG</sub>-2.50, for instance, signifies that the average ranking of the BSTS-X<sub>MG</sub> model, according to the RMSE metric, is 2.50. This same interpretation holds for other models.", please refer to [Figure_04_MCB.R](https://github.com/Donia-212/Forecasting-the-US-Climate-Policy-Uncertainty-using-Bayesian-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Figure_04_MCB.R).

The parameter $\theta$ represents the shape parameter as defined in Eqn.(2). Lower scores indicate better performance.", please refer to [Figure_05_Murphy_Diagram.R](https://github.com/Donia-212/Forecasting-the-US-Climate-Policy-Uncertainty-using-Bayesian-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Figure_05_Murphy_Diagram.R).
